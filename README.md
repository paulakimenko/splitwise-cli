# splitwise

A fast CLI for [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com). Manage groups, expenses, balances, and settlements from your terminal.

## Install

```bash
brew tap example/tap
brew install splitwise
```

Or with Go:

```bash
go install github.com/paulakimenko/splitwise-cli@latest
```

The repository owner values above are placeholders and should be updated to match your own distribution endpoints.

## Setup

1. **Register a Splitwise app** at [secure.splitwise.com/apps](https://secure.splitwise.com/apps)
   - Set the callback URL to `http://localhost:8484/callback`
2. **Authenticate:**

```bash
splitwise auth
```

You'll be prompted for your Client ID and Client Secret. The CLI opens your browser for OAuth, then stores the token at `~/.config/splitwise-cli/auth.json`.

> **Note:** Splitwise ignores `redirect_uri` in OAuth requests and always uses the registered callback URL. If you hit `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` after authorizing, do a manual token exchange with `curl` using the `code` from the URL.

## Usage

```bash
# Who am I?
splitwise me

# Groups & balances
splitwise groups
splitwise group "Household"

# Expenses
splitwise expenses list --group "Household" --limit 20
splitwise expenses list --after 2025-01-01
splitwise expenses create "Dinner" 85.50 --group "Household"
splitwise expenses delete 123456

# Balances
splitwise balances
splitwise balances --group "Household"

# Friends
splitwise friends

# Settle up
splitwise settle "MemberB" --group "Household"

# Set defaults
splitwise config set default_group "Household"
splitwise config set default_currency USD
splitwise config show
```

## Output

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--json` | Raw JSON |
| `--quiet` | IDs/amounts only (for scripting) |
| `--no-color` | No ANSI colors (also respects `NO_COLOR`) |

```bash
splitwise expenses list --quiet | head -5
splitwise balances --json | jq '.[] | select(.amount != "0.00")'
```
